# Randomize7
This project provides a tool for extracting randomness from recorded audio. By recording unpredictable noise sources, such as atmospheric or electronic noise, this tool generates random data that can be used in various applications. This README provides instructions on selecting suitable noise sources, using the software, and testing the quality of the extracted randomness.


## Choosing Noise Sources

To obtain good randomness, it's essential to choose suitable noise sources. Here are some recommendations:

### Recommended Noise Sources

- Atmospheric noise: Sounds generated by natural phenomena like wind, rain, or thunderstorms.
- Electronic noise: Noise produced by electronic components or devices, such as thermal noise, shot noise, or transistor noise.

### Noise Sources to Avoid

- Periodic or predictable sounds: Repetitive sounds, such as ticking clocks or machinery, should be avoided as they do not provide good randomness.
- Music or speech: These sources are structured and not suitable for generating randomness.
- Ambient noise in quiet environments: Background noise in quiet environments may not provide enough entropy for good randomness.

## Run this project

1. Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/your_username/randomness-extractor-from-audio.git
2. Install the required dependencies cargo install --path .
3. Run "cargo run"
4. After running the software, follow the prompts to configure the recording settings and start recording.


## Tests Conducted

To evaluate the quality of the extracted randomness, we conducted several tests using well-known statistical test suites:

1. NIST Statistical Test Suite: The NIST suite provides a collection of tests for assessing the quality of random data. We performed all tests in the suite and analyzed the results to ensure the extracted randomness met the recommended requirements.

2. Dieharder Test Suite: Dieharder is another comprehensive test suite for random number generators. We ran all tests in the Dieharder suite and evaluated the results to confirm the quality of the generated random data.


By passing these tests, we have demonstrated that the extracted randomness is of high quality and suitable for various applications. Note, however, that the quality of the randomness depends on the chosen noise source, recording process, and extraction algorithm. It's important to choose suitable noise sources and fine-tune the settings to achieve the desired level of randomness.
