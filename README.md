# Randomize7
This project provides a tool for extracting randomness from your computer's mic. By recording unpredictable noise sources, such as atmospheric or electronic noise, this tool generates random data that can be used in various applications. This README provides instructions on selecting suitable noise sources, using the software, and testing the quality of the extracted randomness.

## Run this project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies `cargo install`.
3. Run the project with `cargo run`.
4. After running the project, follow the prompts to configure the recording settings and start recording.


TODO:

- [ ] Use substraction technique to enhance randomness quality
- [ ] Use cryptogphic hash function on the output to enhance randomness quality
- [ ] Extend randomness quality testing


## Choosing Noise Sources

To obtain good randomness, it's essential to choose suitable noise sources. Here are some recommendations:

### Recommended Noise Sources

- Atmospheric noise: Sounds generated by natural phenomena like wind, rain, or thunderstorms.
- Electronic noise: Noise produced by electronic components or devices, such as thermal noise, shot noise, or transistor noise.

### Noise Sources to Avoid

- Periodic or predictable sounds: Repetitive sounds, such as ticking clocks or machinery, should be avoided as they do not provide good randomness.
- Music or speech: These sources are structured and not suitable for generating randomness.
- Ambient noise in quiet environments: Background noise in quiet environments may not provide enough entropy for good randomness.


## Tests Conducted

To evaluate the quality of the extracted randomness, we conducted several tests using well-known statistical test suites:
